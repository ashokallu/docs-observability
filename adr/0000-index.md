## Executive Summary

This comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADR) collection documents the foundational technical decisions governing observability architecture across all participating projects. These ADRs represent battle-tested patterns from production deployments and align with 2025+ cloud-native observability best practices.

**Key Architectural Principles:**

- **Monolith-First Learning** with extraction readiness (ADR-001)
- **Zero Global State** for testability and determinism (ADR-002)  
- **Context-First Propagation** using Go idioms (ADR-003)
- **Bounded Cardinality** with cost governance (ADR-004)
- **Structured Error Classification** for actionable alerting (ADR-005)
- **Local-First Development** with cloud promotion paths (ADR-006)
- **Framework Boundaries** with clear abstraction layers (ADR-007)
- **GCP-First Cloud Strategy** with multi-cloud readiness (ADR-008)
- **PII Governance** with tiered exposure controls (ADR-009)
- **Performance Budgets** with automated enforcement (ADR-010)
- **Signal Access Control** with role-based governance (ADR-011)

## ADR Lifecycle and Governance

### Lifecycle States

1. **Proposed** - Draft under review with stakeholder feedback period
2. **Accepted** - Approved and governing; enforceable in CI/CD
3. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer ADR; retained for traceability
4. **Deprecated** - Intentionally sunset; should not be used in new work

### Governance Process

## ADR-0000: ADR Index

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-07-17  
**Tags:** index, governance, documentation

### Context

Architecture Decision Records capture stable, reviewed technical decisions that govern observability architecture across participating projects. Without proper indexing and governance, ADRs become scattered documentation that loses value over time.

### Problem Statement

Teams need a centralized, discoverable way to:

- Track architectural decisions and their current status
- Understand decision evolution and supersession chains
- Enforce architectural compliance in CI/CD pipelines
- Onboard new team members with context

### Decision

Implement a structured ADR system with:

- **Immutable historical records** - ADRs are never deleted, only superseded
- **Sequential numbering** starting from 0000 (this index)
- **Standardized template** with required sections
- **Status tracking** through defined lifecycle states
- **Cross-referencing** between related decisions

### Implementation Guidelines

#### ADR Structure

```markdown
# Title
**Status:** [Proposed|Accepted|Superseded|Deprecated]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tags:** comma, separated, tags

## Context
## Problem Statement  
## Options Considered
## Decision
## Rationale
## Implementation
## Consequences
## References
```

#### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **CI Validation**: `scripts/validate-adrs.sh` checks format and links
- **PR Templates**: Require ADR review for architectural changes
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess ADR relevance and update status

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Clear decision audit trail
- Faster onboarding with context
- Architectural compliance enforcement
- Shared understanding across teams

**Negative:**

- Additional documentation overhead
- Requires discipline to maintain
- Can become bureaucratic if over-applied
