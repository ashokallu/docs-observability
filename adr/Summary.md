# Summary

This comprehensive Architecture Decision Records collection establishes a **dependency injection first, standards-based, production-ready observability foundation** with clear boundaries and enforcement mechanisms. The architecture supports learning with local tooling while maintaining compatibility with cloud observability services.

#### Continuous Integration Checks

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - name: "Import Boundary Enforcement"
    command: "make lint-imports"
    requirement: "Zero violations"
    
  - name: "Cardinality Budget Validation"
    command: "make cardinality-check"
    requirement: "≤1000 series per service"

### Production Readiness Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] **ADR-002**: All dependencies injected via constructors, zero package-level variables
- [ ] **ADR-003**: All exported functions accept `context.Context` as first parameter
- [ ] **ADR-004**: Metric cardinality ≤1000 active series per service
- [ ] **ADR-005**: All errors use structured `AppError` with classification
- [ ] **ADR-006**: Local development stack verified with `make smoke-test`
- [ ] **ADR-007**: Framework code isolated in `api/middleware/` and `api/handlers/`
- [ ] **ADR-008**: GCP infrastructure provisioned via Terraform modules
- [ ] **ADR-009**: PII redaction policies configured for production environment
- [ ] **ADR-010**: Performance budgets defined and SLO monitoring active
- [ ] **ADR-011**: RBAC implemented with audit trails enabled

### Reusability and Template Strategy

This ADR collection serves as a **reusable template** for any Go backend API project:

1. **Copy ADR decisions** that match your architectural requirements
2. **Adapt configurations** for your specific cloud provider and scale
3. **Implement phases incrementally** based on team capacity and business needs
4. **Enforce boundaries** using the provided tooling and validation scripts
5. **Measure and optimize** using the performance budgets and SLO frameworks

The decisions create a foundation that scales from single-service APIs to large-scale distributed systems while maintaining observability excellence and operational discipline.

**Key Success Factors:**

- **Start simple** with local development (ADR-006)
- **Enforce boundaries** from day one (ADR-002, ADR-007)
- **Measure everything** including observability overhead (ADR-010)
- **Protect data** from the beginning (ADR-009, ADR-011)
- **Plan for scale** with modular architecture (ADR-001, ADR-008)

This architecture decision framework ensures that observability becomes a **competitive advantage** rather than technical debt, enabling teams to build reliable, observable, and maintainable systems that support business growth.
